In this project, we will analyze an online retail dataset by performing a retention cohort analysis using SQL. A cohort refers to a group of individuals who share a common experience within a defined time period. Cohort Analysis is a powerful method for gaining actionable insights into customer behavior, such as churn rates, product engagement, product value, and other key metrics. This technique is applicable across various domains and technologies, offering strong capabilities for data evaluation.
